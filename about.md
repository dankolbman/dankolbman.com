# {{ page.title }}

I'm Daniel Kolbman. I'm 19. I study Physics at RIT. I'm fascinated by the ease at which complex phenomena can be expressed with only a handful of symbols. I love collecting, fitting, extrapolating, and analyzing data and using visualizations to give it deeper meaning. I'm inspired by the antics of [Richard Feynman](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Feynman) and the personalities like [P.A.M. Dirac](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Dirac). I'm an advocate of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_science" title="Open Science">Open Science</a> and, when I retire, I will be moving to Mars.

Outside physics, I dabble in electronics and programming and study people and the curious things they do. I greatly ejoy listening to trance, goa, minimal and other forms of electronic music. I appreciate a good cup of coffee or tea and a <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1612774/" title="good movie">good movie</a>.

# The Site

The goals of this site are three-fold:
1. I do some self study and learn about an interesting topic
2. I present gathered information to the reader through a problem or some example
3. I wait for readers to (hopefully) respond with comments and critisizm that will drive constructive conversation

Goal number three is my long term aim. I hope to one day be able to host a hub of scientific and intelligent conversation on and provoke new and innovative views and solutions to asked and unasked questions alike.

# Technical

I chose to use [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll "Jekyll") for static site generation in conjunction with [Blahtex](http://gva.noekeon.org/blahtexml/ "Blahtex") for png rendering of LaTeX to serve up a 100% static site with zero external dependencies. This allow me freedom from constant updates, long loading times, security vulnerabilities, bulky backends, and spontaneous bugs which I simply do not have time for.
