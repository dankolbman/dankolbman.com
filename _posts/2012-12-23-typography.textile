95% of the information on the web is written language. It is only logical to say that a web designer should get good training in the main discipline of shaping written information, in other words:Typography.

Back in 1969, Emil Ruder, a famous Swiss typographer, wrote on behalf of his contemporary print materials what we could easily say about our contemporary websites:

<blockquote> Today we are inundated with such an immense flood of printed matter that the value of the individual work has depreciated, for our harassed contemporaries simply cannot take everything that is printed today. It is the typographer?s task to divide up and organize and interpret this mass of printed matter in such a way that the reader will have a good chance of finding what is of interest to him.</blockquote>

With some imagination (replace print with online) this sounds like the job description of an information designer. It is the information designer?s task ?to divide up and organize and interpret this mass of printed matter in such a way that the reader will have a good chance of finding what is of interest to him?.
